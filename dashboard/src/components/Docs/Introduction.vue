    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Zeppelin is a private moderation bot for Discord, designed with large servers and reliability in mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting the bot</h2>
    <p>
      Since the bot is currently private, access to the bot is granted on a case by case basis.<br>
      There are plans to streamline this process in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      All Zeppelin configuration is done through the dashboard by editing a YAML config file. By default, only the server
      owner has access to this, but they can give other users access as they see fit. See <router-link to="/docs/configuration-format">Configuration format</router-link> for more details.
